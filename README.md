# LightlyShaders v3.0
 This is a fork of Luwx's [LightlyShaders](https://github.com/Luwx/LightlyShaders), which in turn is a fork of [ShapeCorners](https://sourceforge.net/projects/shapecorners/).  

 **It now also includes a fork of KWin Blur effect to fix the "korner bug".** It is disabled by default, you will have to enter Effects settings, disable the stock blur and enable the one with the "LightlyShaders" lable.

 This effect works correctly with stock Plasma effects:

# Warning:

**This is a work in progress branch!**
It may crash, contain new bugs, require installation of additional development packages to compile or not compile for you at all!

To build on Plasma 6 RC1 you will have to download **effect/xcb.h** header manually (see [related bugreport](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=479584)).

I tested this on Wayland only, so it may not compile or run on X11 for now.

This branch is expected to work with any window decoration and theme (though some adjustments may be necessary, like disabling window borders and stock outline in Breeze).

# Dependencies:
 
Plasma >= 6.0.
 
You will need qt6, kf6 and kwin development packages.

# Manual installation
```
git clone https://github.com/a-parhom/LightlyShaders

cd LightlyShaders;

mkdir qt6build; cd qt6build; cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr && make && sudo make install
```

## Note
After some updates of Plasma this plugin may need to be recompiled in order to work with changes introduced to KWin.
